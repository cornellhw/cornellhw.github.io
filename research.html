    </button>   
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> Utilizing 2000-2017 panel data on 2,394 counties in China, this paper estimates the impact of ecological transfer payments (ETPs) on county-level carbon emissions and further examines the impact of local government behavior on the policy effect from the perspectives of incentive theory and collaborative governance theory. This paper regards the implementation of ETPs as a quasi-natural experiment and adopts the time-varying DID method for causal inference. The empirical results show that (1) the ecological compensation policy has an inhibitory effect on county (district)-level carbon emissions. The results of the parallel trend test, the placebo test and repeated random sampling show the robustness of this effect. (2) In terms of the mediating effect, an increase in the total expenditure and industrial expenditure of local governments weaken the carbon emission reduction effect, indicating that there is a certain expenditure distortion in compensation funds, reflecting insufficient vertical incentives. (3) The transfer of financial power and the decentralization of expenditure responsibility hinder the effect of policy implementation. The carbon emission reduction effect in municipal administrative units is weaker than that in county-level administrative units, indicating that there may be conflicts of interest between cities and the counties that are under their jurisdiction (i.e., cities inhibit counties) in the transfer of ETP funds. On the basis of the findings, we suggest gradually forming an ecological environment governance system with rigid constraints: the principle of "who protects is who benefits" should be emphasized in the implementation of policies to prevent the loss of public service guarantee capacity caused by insufficient incentives.</p></div>

    Abstract   
    </button>   
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> Since 2013, China has implemented a large-scale initiative to systematically deploy solar photovoltaic projects aimed at alleviating poverty in rural areas. To further explore the synergistic effect of this project on increasing farmers' production and income, this article utilizes 41,426 manually collected county-level datasets from 2000 to 2019 to construct a time-varying DID model. It has been found that the PPAP project increases farmers' annual income by 200 yuan and can effectively improve the overall green productivity of agriculture. Among the four mainstream types of photovoltaic poverty alleviation, household, and village joint-level photovoltaic power plants yield relatively high average benefits. Our results are robust across alternative norms and variable definitions. However, the effectiveness of PPAP projects in impoverished areas, especially in the western region, is limited. Based on these conclusions, we have proposed several policy recommendations to maintain and enhance China's progress in deploying photovoltaic poverty alleviation.</p></div>

    Abstract   
    </button>   
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> In light of the underdeveloped environmental information disclosure system in China and the 'decoupling' between the disclosed content and the actual environmental performance, this paper utilizes frameworks from the emerging field of media studies, specifically those concerning symbolic CSR (corporate social responsibility) 'talk' and substantive 'walk.' The aim is to investigate the varying motives behind corporate environmental information disclosure and their respective financial consequences. Specifically, this study classifies the panel data of 70 renewable energy companies listed in China from 2011 to 2020 into four categories of environmental information disclosure drivers, based on the relative levels of CSR 'talk' and 'walk': voluntary disclosure, resource dependence, compliance motivation, and disclosure inability. It is further observed that under the first two motivations for disclosure, a positive correlation exists between CSR 'talk' and financial performance; conversely, a negative correlation is noted for the latter two motivations. Additionally, it was found that companies with a better investment environment, strong local environmental regulation, weaker constraints on local government economic growth objectives, and superior internal governance, experience a mitigated negative impact of CSR decoupling on financial performance. We suggest that the government bears the responsibility of fostering a conducive market and policy environment, thereby facilitating better CSR 'walk' practices among enterprises.</p></div>

    Abstract   
    </button>   
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> Prediction of stock prices or trends have attracted financial researchers’ attention for many years. Recently, machine learning models such as neural networks have significantly contributed to this research problem. These methods often enable researchers to take stock-related factors such as sentiment information into consideration, improving prediction accuracies. At present, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks is one of the best techniques known to learn knowledge from time-series data and to predict future tendencies. The inception of generative adversarial networks (GANs) also provides researchers with diversified and powerful methods to explore the stock prediction problem. A GAN network consists of two sub-networks known as generator and discriminator, which work together to minimize maximum loss on both actual and simulated data. In this paper, we developed a sentiment-guided adversarial learning and predictive models of stock prices, adopting a popular variation of GAN called conditional GAN (CGAN). We adopted an LSTM network in the generator and a multilayer perceptron (MLP) network in the discriminator. After extensively pre-processing historical stock price datasets, we analyzed the sentiment information from daily tweets and computed sentiment scores as an additional model feature. Our experiments demonstrated that the average forecast accuracies of the CGAN models were improved with sentiment data. Moreover, our GAN and CGAN models outperformed LSTM and other traditional methods on 11 out of 36 processed stock price datasets, potentially playing a part in ensemble methods.</p></div>
