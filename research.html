    Abstract   
    </button>   
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> Utilizing 2000-2017 panel data on 2,394 counties in China, this paper estimates the impact of ecological transfer payments (ETPs) on county-level carbon emissions and further examines the impact of local government behavior on the policy effect from the perspectives of incentive theory and collaborative governance theory. This paper regards the implementation of ETPs as a quasi-natural experiment and adopts the time-varying DID method for causal inference. The empirical results show that (1) the ecological compensation policy has an inhibitory effect on county (district)-level carbon emissions. The results of the parallel trend test, the placebo test and repeated random sampling show the robustness of this effect. (2) In terms of the mediating effect, an increase in the total expenditure and industrial expenditure of local governments weaken the carbon emission reduction effect, indicating that there is a certain expenditure distortion in compensation funds, reflecting insufficient vertical incentives. (3) The transfer of financial power and the decentralization of expenditure responsibility hinder the effect of policy implementation. The carbon emission reduction effect in municipal administrative units is weaker than that in county-level administrative units, indicating that there may be conflicts of interest between cities and the counties that are under their jurisdiction (i.e., cities inhibit counties) in the transfer of ETP funds. On the basis of the findings, we suggest gradually forming an ecological environment governance system with rigid constraints: the principle of "who protects is who benefits" should be emphasized in the implementation of policies to prevent the loss of public service guarantee capacity caused by insufficient incentives.</p></div>

    </button>   
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> This study delves into the impact of photovoltaic (PV) poverty alleviation initiatives in rural China from 2000 to 2019, using a comprehensive dataset of approximately 41,426 data points from various levels of government. Our analysis is structured around four pivotal hypotheses. Hypothesis 1 posits that PV poverty alleviation increases rural per capita disposable income by creating additional income channels for farmers. Hypothesis 2 suggests a threefold environmental benefit: (1) PV power plants reduce carbon emissions by replacing coal power, enhancing the green productivity of agriculture; (2) these plants contribute to green productivity by facilitating agricultural mechanization; and (3) they further improve agricultural green productivity through increased crop yields. Hypothesis 3 explores the broader economic impact, asserting that PV poverty alleviation as an industrial policy generates positive externalities, stimulating economic development in surrounding regions. Finally, Hypothesis 4 examines the differential effects of various PV plant policies. To evaluate these hypotheses, we employ a time-varying Difference-in-Differences (DID) approach coupled with a fixed-effect model. Our findings illuminate the multifaceted role of renewable energy policies in rural economic development, highlighting how PV initiatives not only contribute to environmental sustainability but also foster significant economic benefits.</p></div>

    Abstract   
    </button>   
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> In view of the low construction level of China's environmental information disclosure system and the "decoupling" between the disclosed content and the actual environmental performance, this paper adopts the relevant frameworks of symbolic CSR (corporate social responsibility) "talk" and substantive "walk" in the emerging literature of media studies to explore the different motives of corporate environmental information disclosure and corresponding financial consequences. Specifically, the panel data of 70 renewable energy listed companies in China from 2011 to 2020 to were classified into four types of environmental information disclosure driving forces according to the relative level of CSR "talk" and "walks": voluntary disclosure, resource dependence, compliance motivation and disclosure inability. It is further found that under the first two disclosure motivations, CSR “talk” and financial performance show a positive correlation; as for the latter two, there is a negative correlation. We also found that for those companies with better investment environment, strong local environmental supervision, weak constraints on local government economic growth goals and better internal governance environment, the negative effect of CSR decouple on financial performance has been alleviated. We suggest that the government has the responsibility to create a good market and policy environment and provide a friendly external environment for cultivating good CSR "walk" behavior of enterprises.</p></div>

    Abstract   
    </button>   
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> Prediction of stock prices or trends have attracted financial researchers’ attention for many years. Recently, machine learning models such as neural networks have significantly contributed to this research problem. These methods often enable researchers to take stock-related factors such as sentiment information into consideration, improving prediction accuracies. At present, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks is one of the best techniques known to learn knowledge from time-series data and to predict future tendencies. The inception of generative adversarial networks (GANs) also provides researchers with diversified and powerful methods to explore the stock prediction problem. A GAN network consists of two sub-networks known as generator and discriminator, which work together to minimize maximum loss on both actual and simulated data. In this paper, we developed a sentiment-guided adversarial learning and predictive models of stock prices, adopting a popular variation of GAN called conditional GAN (CGAN). We adopted an LSTM network in the generator and a multilayer perceptron (MLP) network in the discriminator. After extensively pre-processing historical stock price datasets, we analyzed the sentiment information from daily tweets and computed sentiment scores as an additional model feature. Our experiments demonstrated that the average forecast accuracies of the CGAN models were improved with sentiment data. Moreover, our GAN and CGAN models outperformed LSTM and other traditional methods on 11 out of 36 processed stock price datasets, potentially playing a part in ensemble methods.</p></div>
